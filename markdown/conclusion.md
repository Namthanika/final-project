# CONCLUSION

## Dataset
The dataset that we are using only consider bigger cities where Zillow customers exist. Since only considering bigger city,
the average housing price in a state can be overestimated. However, when using the data to analyze the trend,
the displayed charts can indicate the trend from the past years very well which can help audience to predict the housing price/rent
in US, in a given state and in a certain state.


## Trends
From the plots we show,
* in general, housing price has been increasing gradually since 2012
* Housing tends to be cheaper in the middle of the United States.
* New York and California have hold one of the states with the most expensive houses.
